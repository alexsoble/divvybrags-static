  <h3>* <u>What happened to my score?</u> *</h3>
  <p><i>Divvy recently updated the structure of their website. Trips are now are stored by month. That means DivvyBrags has to calculate the leaderboard differently! Post each of your Divvy months to the leaderboard under same name, and you'll get both an all-time and a month-by-month ranking.</i></p>
